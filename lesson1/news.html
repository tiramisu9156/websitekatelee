    <p><strong><em>Look, I'm not gonna lie. There are some problems with my carousel, and I canâ€™t blame these folks for voicing their dissatisfaction in their extremely negative online reviews of my business.</em></strong></p>

        <h2>From Meghan B.</h2>
        <p>Meghan B. is not exaggerating here. The poles on my carousel are very hot. I do not know why that is the case. I think it might have something to do with the poles rubbing up against some of the gears down underneath, but I am not sure. I have tried to cool them off by spraying them down with water, but that has not worked. For a while, I tried using a chemical coolant on the poles, but it was giving people rashes, so I went back to water. Obviously, the high temperature of the poles and general wetness of the carousel on a whole are legitimate concerns, and I am doing my best to address them.</p>

        <h2>From Allison Y.</h2>
        <p>Okay, so ideally, the carousel would move around and around instead of up and down. I understand that people expect a carousel to move a certain way, and it is unfortunate that mine does a different and worse thing. But I am doing the best I can. I am not an engineer. I do not have the technical know-how to make it rotate. This is something I have made peace with.</p>
